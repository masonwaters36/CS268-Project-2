Report and Client Critique

1.	Our website is targeted at the online community of people looking to get started with custom PC building. It acts as a hub to direct people 
to more specific informational sites, as well as references to other PC communities such as esports.
2.	Our website uses headings on many pages such as the how to build a PC page, the gaming competitions page, and the build types page.
3.	Our website has ten pages with organized information and references to other resources.
4.	Our webpage has navigation links on each page. Each page makes use of a navbar for navigating around the site.
5.	Our website uses media queries on different pages which would otherwise be hard to read given smaller screens. Other pages are designed with
 resizing in mind.
6.	Each page uses a similar layout for the navbar, header, and footer. Customization is made around the main body for each page.
7.	The images on our webpage include brief “alt” descriptions for support with browsers which don’t render images.
8.	Each of the webpages implements a shared favicon.
9.	All of the non-HTML assets our site uses are organized into their own folders.
10.	Our website does not use any frameworks such as bootstraps.
11.	Our webpages pass the validators without any warnings.
12.	Our website is stored in a Git repository.
13.	Our file names are all lowercase.
14.	All of our pages contain clear information which is neatly aligned.
15.	We make use of different fonts with our headings on multiple pages.
16.	All external sites which are linked are relevant to the content and open in the new tabs.
17.	The names of all of our files/id’s/classes etc. have meaningful names and our code is formatted consistently.
18.	Each page on our site includes a consistent navbar which helps users navigate through each of our pages.
19.	Each page on our site has a header with a relevant title heading, and a footer with our contact information.
20.	We implement grids on multiple pages in different ways. On our personal builds page, they are used in combination with lists to create a 
cleaner list format. Our gaming competition page’s main body is created with a grid format. We use flexboxes on multiple pages as well. In 
particular the how to build a pc page uses extensive use of flexboxes and Cards.

Client Critique:
Critique given by: Matt Vanselow (Friend of Mason, interested in building a gaming PC)

The home page has a short and concise description of the contents. The text font seems too big, and the end of the main body of text almost touches 
out of the colored box. The color scheme and font style are visually appealing and appropriate. The image in the heading on the top left is a good, 
readable picture but it touches the tip of the colored box that it’s in. The image on the right is too small to be readable. The nab bar is intuitive 
and visually appealing. Under “How to Build a PC”, the boxes contain text that is squished into narrow vertical columns, which seems unintended. The 
contents of the boxes however are informative and have working reference links. All of the pictures are readable and appropriate. “Helpful Links” is 
a simple page with links that work as intended. The FAQ page features drop down text that works as intended and it was used in a useful way. “Parts 
Recommendations” is a similar page with no problems. “Personal Builds” has good images and text, but the text placement could be changed to be more 
visually appealing. “Types of Builds” has simple images and text and is very visually appealing. “Games to Buy” shares similar text placements issues 
compared to “Personal Builds”. “Common Mistakes” is a good page with drop down text, but the last section can be pushed too close to the bottom, 
causing text to almost reach the bottom of the colored box.
