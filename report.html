Report and Client Critique

1.	Our website is targeted at the online community of people looking to get started with custom PC building. It acts as a hub to direct people 
    to more specific informational sites, as well as references to other PC communities such as esports.
2.	Our website uses headings on many pages such as the how to build a PC page, the gaming competitions page, and the build types page.
3.	Our website has ten pages with organized information and references to other resources.
4.	Our webpage has navigation links on each page. Each page makes use of a navbar for navigating around the site.
5.	Our website uses media queries on different pages which would otherwise be hard to read given smaller screens. Other pages are designed with
    resizing in mind.
6.	Each page uses a similar layout for the navbar, header, and footer. Customization is made around the main body for each page.
7.	The images on our webpage include brief “alt” descriptions for support with browsers which don’t render images.
8.	Each of the webpages implements a shared favicon.
9.	All of the non-HTML assets our site uses are organized into their own folders. There is also a directory for the JS, PHP and SQL
10.	Our website does not use any frameworks such as bootstrap. We chose not to use it because we were happy with our previous styling and 
    kept the same formatting.
11.	Our webpages pass the validators without any warnings.
12.	Our website is stored in a Git repository.
13.	Our file names are all lowercase.
14.	All of our pages contain clear information which is neatly aligned.
15.	We have included all 4 website using forms. The first is the log in page which works very well. The second is the user recommended game page 
    which has a form for users to recommend their favorite games with. The third is user parts recommended page which allows users to recommend parts
    they like. And then the fourth page is the links to parts page that allows users to enter parts they find on the internet during this part shortage
    the world is experiencing. All of these pages use POST and GET requests.
16.	All external sites which are linked are relevant to the content and open in the new tabs.
17.	The names of all of our files/id’s/classes etc. have meaningful names and our code is formatted consistently.
18.	The animation we used is
19.	All of our forms use a MySQL database to store and retreive data. Our pages display what is in the database and you can enter stuff into the 
    database with the forms.
20.	We implemented a log in page which allows a user to log in. It stores user log in information so they can log in and log out at their leisure. 
    That is about all the log in page does as of this moment, though.
21. Addressing comments from feedback in project 1:
    1.) We have made the nav bar have bigger text so that it is more visually appealing.
    2.) We changed the link size so they are smaller.
    3.) We decided we liked the style of our images so did not make any changes.
    4.) We did not change the divs to our website because we liked the simple style.
    5.) We were unsure how to implement this change and felt our cards were styled adequately.
    6.) We did not test the mobile experience and felt it not necessary for this project.
    7.) The information on our pages is necessary to inform the user. We would rather not separate among multiple pages because each page serves 
        their own purpose.
    8.) We added a page where users could submit links to parts that they find that are in stock.
    9.) Header text should be centered horizontally now. Also, We did not find our padding and margins to be formatted improperly. 
    10.) We felt that our font was not necessary to be changed for this project but could do it later on if we ever decided to style the pages
        differently. This would be a complete redesign of the website.
    11.) Not sure what is meant by "improve user interaction".
    12.) We did not improve visual layout of the website this time around, but a complete redesign of the website could make it much nicer in the future.
    13.) Added margin and padding to the cards.
    14.) Added a parts list for users to put their recommended parts lists on. This is done with a form!
    15.) We felt the pages had adequate spacing on them with respect to the content.
    16.) Not sure what is meant by adding different subheadings with respect to what we have for content.

Which web pages have forms in them:
    - userpartsrecommendations.php
    - usergamerecommendations.php 
    - partlinksfromuser.php 
    - loginpage.php

Contribution of each group member for this project:
    - Shane completed the login page and the userpartsrecommendations page. He added funtionality and styling for these and also did the CSS animation. 
        Since we just added on from our last project, not a whole lot of styling or redesigning was needed. 
    - Mason completed the usergamerecommendations and the partlinksfromuser pages. He added functionality and styling for these. He also did the 
        report and the critique from the client. Since we just added on from our last project, not a whole lot of styling or redesigning was needed.

The home page has a short and concise description of the contents. The text font seems too big, and the end of the main body of text almost touches 
out of the colored box. The color scheme and font style are visually appealing and appropriate. The image in the heading on the top left is a good, 
readable picture but it touches the tip of the colored box that it’s in. The image on the right is too small to be readable. The nab bar is intuitive 
and visually appealing. Under “How to Build a PC”, the boxes contain text that is squished into narrow vertical columns, which seems unintended. The 
contents of the boxes however are informative and have working reference links. All of the pictures are readable and appropriate. “Helpful Links” is 
a simple page with links that work as intended. The FAQ page features drop down text that works as intended and it was used in a useful way. “Parts 
Recommendations” is a similar page with no problems. “Personal Builds” has good images and text, but the text placement could be changed to be more 
visually appealing. “Types of Builds” has simple images and text and is very visually appealing. “Games to Buy” shares similar text placements issues 
compared to “Personal Builds”. “Common Mistakes” is a good page with drop down text, but the last section can be pushed too close to the bottom, 
causing text to almost reach the bottom of the colored box.
