            <div class="gamedesc">
                <p>Hollow Knight is a 2d platformer, metroidvania. It's considered by many to be the best modern metroidvania, beating out games which built the genre
                    like Super Metroid, and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. The player plays as the knight as they traverses through Hollow Nest fighting through hordes
                    of enemies, finding upgrades, fighting bosses, and trying to uncover the truth behind their past.
