        This is basically just a list of things to avoid doing when building your computer: <br> <br>
        <details open>
            <summary>Buying a cheap and low quality power supply</summary>
            <div class="solution">
                <p>Buying a cheap power supply not only increases the risk of a system falure, but can also destroy other
                    parts with it when it fails. Brand name power supplies are generally always a good option, and usually
                    have pretty good warranty options.
                </p>
            </div>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Spending too much on low impact components and too little on important components</summary>
            <div class="solution">
                <p>This usually has to do with spending most of your budget on something like a GPU and cheaping out on other 
                    comonents. This doesnt work well because all of your parts need to work together. If one thing is lacking, it
                    can cause the whole system to lack.

        <details>
            <summary>Accidentally choosing components that arent compatible with eachother</summary>
            <div class="solution">
                <p>An easy way to avoid this is to use something like PC part picker that will only show you parts that are compatible 
                    with parts you have already chosen. For example, if you select an Intel CPU, it will only show you motherboards
                    that are compatible with intel CPU's. Here is a link to PC part picker: <a style="color:blue; background-color:lightgray;"

            <summary>Picking a CPU that can be overclocked with a motherboard that doesnt support overclocking</summary>
            <div class="solution">
                <p>When choosing a CPU that supports overclocking, make sure you also select a motherboard that supports it. this
                    can be found out be reading the specifications and reviews on a motherboard and CPU.

        <details>
            <summary>Choosing a GPU that is too powerful/too weak for a monitor</summary>
            <div class="solution">
                <p>When choosing a GPU, you want to be mindful of whether or not it is too powerful or too weak for your current monitor
                    or a monitor you intend on buying. This means checking resolution/latency/fps rating on a monitor and ensuring that 
                    your GPU supports that.
                </p>
            </div>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Failing to keep in mind the outputs your monitor and GPU have</summary>
            <div class="solution">
                <p>You want to make sure that your monitor and GPU have the same output/inputs otherwise you wont be able to connect the 
                    monitor to the PC.
                </p>

        <details>
            <summary>Choosing knock off brands to save money</summary>
            <div class="solution">
                <p>As talked about in the low quality power supply section, if you choose parts that are low quality low cost in order to 
                    save a few bucks, you could end up hurting or destroying the rest of your system in the long run. This leads to costly repairs
                    and sometimes whole new systems.

            <summary>Forgetting to buy Windows</summary>
            <div class="solution">
                <p>Dont forget to buy Windows! Your PC needs an operating system to boot with.</p>

            <summary>Building a overly capable PC with bad internet</summary>
            <div class="solution">
                <p>If you build a really nice gaming computer, you're going to want decent internet to pair with it otherwise you wont be able to game.
                    Multiplayer gaming these days requires a strong internet connection otherwise you will have lots of lag and in some cases will 
                    straight up not even be able to connect.

        <details>
            <summary>Ignoring cable management</summary>
            <div class="solution">
                <p>Poor cable management can cause airflow issues which overheat the PC and in some cases ruin parts. It can also cause dust buildup in
                    not so great places of the case. Manage those cables!
