            <summary>Does PC gaming cost more than console gaming?</summary>
            <div class="answers">
                <p>In most cases, yes, console gaming is far cheaper, but it doesn’t have to. In terms of hardware, 
                    you can get a good quality gaming experience while generally paying the same amount. That being said, 
                    consoles now game in 4K and that is something that currently will cost you a lot more to do on PC.</p>

            <summary>Do I have to build my own PC?</summary>
            <div class="answers">
                <p>It’s a fun time, but you don’t have to. If you aren’t comfortable doing it yourself, find a local PC 
                    hardware shop to do it for you. They’ll usually be eager to help out. Alternatively, you could try
                    buying a custom prebuilt PC, which most major manufacturers produce.</p>

            <summary>How much does it cost to build a gaming PC?</summary>
            <div class="answers">
                <p>Just like any PC or laptop, how much a gaming PC costs depends on your individual budget and needs! It can 
                    cost anywhere from $300 to $2000, and many people like to occupy a happy in-between at around $500-$700. 
                    Whether you’re on a budget and pinching pennies or a big shot who wants the best of the best, PC gaming is 
                    there for you. Check out our How to Build a Gaming PC guide for a more detailed breakdown of pricing tiers.</p>

            <summary>How long does it take to build a PC?</summary>
            <div class="answers">
                <p>For your first time, it can be as long as two-three hours. With help or experience, it shouldn’t ever take 
                    longer than one hour, especially once you really know what you’re doing. If you take time to prep beforehand 
                    by watching videos and reading your manuals, you can shorten the process significantly.</p>

            <summary>How hard is it to build a gaming PC?</summary>
            <div class="answers">
                <p>Not too hard. If you follow the instructions and are building in a safe environment, it’s pretty hard to 
                    screw up: everything has a set place. You won’t accidentally plug your GPU into your CPU slot, for instance. 
                    If you’re ever in doubt when building, consult your motherboard manual and the manual for the part that you’re 
                    attempting to install. This will usually clear up any confusion and help you finish up.</p>

            <summary>What tools do you need to build a PC?</summary>
            <div class="answers">
                <p>Almost no tools are actually necessary for most builds, but a screwdriver will be a necessity for standoff 
                    screws and mounting other components, like your cooler or your drives. Your case will often come with thumbscrews 
                    to make installing expansion cards easier, as well.</p>

            <summary>Do I have to buy Windows?</summary>
            <div class="answers">
                <p>Windows will provide the best all-around compatibility and support, but you can use Linux if you want. Linux can 
                    provide a great gaming experience, and is always getting more and more support. If you opt to save money by going 
                    for Linux, we recommend Linux Mint.</p>

            <summary>Do I need to buy a disc drive?</summary>
            <div class="answers">
                <p>Unless there’s something you need it for, no. Most users only use their disc drive once: when installing Windows. 
                    If you have another PC and a USB stick on hand, however, you can create a USB Windows installer that you can use 
                    instead, saving you the trouble of installing a disc drive that you’re only going to use once. If you ever need one 
                    later, you can always buy one.</p>

            <summary>What do I need to overclock?</summary>
            <div class="answers">
                <p>A compatible motherboard and a compatible CPU. Intel “K” series CPUs are overclockable, as are all AMD CPUs. Older 
                    AMD motherboards will all support overclocking, but Ryzen and Intel-K CPUs will require certain motherboard chipsets 
                    to allow overclocking. Be sure to check before buying your motherboard if this is a feature you need.</p>

            <summary>Do I need a liquid cooler?</summary>
            <div class="answers">
                <p>These are recommended for overclocking and the higher-end processors, but no. There are many great air coolers on the 
                    market that can perform similarly but maybe louder due to the presence of fans and have large heatsinks. Liquid coolers 
                    also require a bit more work when it comes to long-term maintenance, so if you’re new to PC building it may be best to 
                    stick with air.</p>

            <summary>Do I need to buy all my parts at once?</summary>
            <div class="answers">
                <p>Not at all. Many people space out their purchases over time, and you may even be able to assemble your PC before 
                    acquiring certain components. For instance, if you have every part of your PC except a graphics card, you may be 
                    able to run your PC off of your processor’s integrated graphics until you can afford to buy a GPU.</p>
