            <summary>Motherboard Recommendations</summary>
            <div class="recommended">
                <p>Your motherboard decision should be based on what type of PC you want to build. Each brand and type of motherboard 
                    supports different things. If you care more about future proofing, you may want to choose a motherboard that has current 
                    or next generation hardware meaning it will likely support future parts like RAM and CPU’s. If you care only about a decent 
                    PC for the time being, you may be able to go a bit cheaper on a motherboard for current generation parts. Different 
                    motherboards also support different speeds in parts such as storage devices that are clocked at different speeds. Refer to 
                    this link when choosing a motherboard. <a style="color:blue; background-color:lightgray;"

            <summary>Case Recommendations</summary>
            <div class="recommended">
                <p>Cases are pretty much just aesthetic with respect to motherboard size and airflow. That being said, your choice 
                    on a case should be based on those three things. Choose a case that you think looks good, but read reviews to see 
                    how well it does with airflow. When you decide on a motherboard, you will be able to choose on a case based on whether
                    or not it supports ATX or Micro-ATX sized motherboards. Refer to this link for a better reference at picking a case:

            <summary>CPU Recommendations</summary>
            <div class="recommended">
                <p>CPU’s or “computer processing units” are the brain of the computer. There are pretty much two main brands to go with, 
                    Intel and AMD. Your choice in processor will be based on what you plan on doing with the computer. If you plan on doing 
                    a lot of multi-tasking, you may want a CPU with a few more cores. If you plan on doing strictly gaming, a faster processor 
                    with less cores may be necessary. Refer to this link that goes more in depth about what CPU to choose for multiple occasions:

            <summary>RAM Recommendations</summary>
            <div class="recommended">
                <p>The two best things to consider when choosing RAM is speed and the amount. Pretty much the standard in terms of amount of RAM 
                    these days is 16gb for most applications. It’s enough to game with, multitask and then anything else you may want to do with 
                    your PC. Although, you can get by with 8gb, and then you can get as much as a few hundred GB if you have the money to spend 
                    on it. Refer to this link when choosing RAM:

            <summary>GPU Recommendations</summary>
            <div class="recommended">
                <p>There are a ton of factors to consider when choosing a GPU. Sometimes you may not even need a GPU, and then other times if 
                    you plan on doing a lot of gaming, a strong GPU is needed. GPU’s can also vary a lot in price so there’s that to consider. 
                    Refer to this video that goes very in to depth on GPU’s:

            <summary>Storage Recommendations</summary>
            <div class="recommended">
                <p>The two biggest things to consider for storage are size and speed. It’s always a good idea to have a lot of storage on your 
                    computer, and buying Hard Drives these days is relatively inexpensive. But when it comes to speed, you will often want your 
                    storage for things like your operating system to be fast and efficient which is when a SSD would come in handy. Refer to this 
                    video for a storage buying guide:

            <summary>PSU Recommendations</summary>
            <div class="recommended">
                <p>The power supply you choose for your PC will be based on power wattage and power standards. There are different tiers to 
                    efficiency of power supplies which correlates to how efficiently the power supply draws power from the wall. The wattage 
                    is how much power the PSU supplies to the system. This is also a case where more than enough wattage is a good thing, but 
                    not necessary. Refer to this link as a more in depth guide:
